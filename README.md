## Overview

Bedrock is a WordPress boilerplate for developers that want to manage their projects with Git and Composer. Much of the philosophy behind Bedrock is inspired by the [Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/) methodology, including the [WordPress specific version](https://roots.io/twelve-factor-wordpress/).

- Better folder structure
- Dependency management with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
- Easy WordPress configuration with environment specific files
- Environment variables with [Dotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv)
- Autoloader for mu-plugins (use regular plugins as mu-plugins)
- Enhanced security (separated web root and secure passwords with [wp-password-bcrypt](https://github.com/roots/wp-password-bcrypt))
